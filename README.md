# Prime-number-generating-and-checking

Prime Checking: To determine if a number is prime, check if it's divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any of these, itâ€™s not prime; otherwise, it is prime.

Prime Generation: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to generate all prime numbers up to a certain limit. It involves marking the multiples of each prime number as non-prime and collecting the remaining numbers as primes.

Key Points:
A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
Use the square root rule for checking primality (check divisibility up to the square root of the number).
Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient way to generate prime numbers up to a specified limit.
